<h1>Selenium Based Captcha Solver (still on progress)</h1>

This project solve captchas where we need to select an image with the help of chatgpt.

The project is still under development.

The code is currently working fine except for the chatgpt connection. I haven't tested that part yet as I haven't purchased the chatgpt token.

If you test or improve it, please leave a comment.
